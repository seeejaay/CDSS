          <p class="txt-theme">
            Diabetes mellitus is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by
            elevated blood glucose levels that usually occurs when the body does
            not produce enough insulin or when it has an inability to
            effectively use the insulin it produces. Insulin is a hormone that
            regulates blood glucose. People with diabetes mellitus experience
            Hyperglycemia, it is a condition where an individual has a raised
            blood glucose or increased blood sugar levels and an uncontrolled
            diabetes over time may lead to serious damages to the different body
            systems wherein the nerves and blood vessels are at high risk.

          Maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
          and lean proteins while limiting sugary and high-fat foods. Regular
          physical activity, such as brisk walking or cycling, helps control
          blood sugar levels and improves insulin sensitivity. Monitoring blood
          sugar levels regularly and taking prescribed medications as directed
          by a healthcare professional are also crucial. Additionally, managing
          stress, getting enough sleep, and avoiding tobacco and excessive
          alcohol consumption contribute to overall diabetes management and

          For example, most people would count a small baked potato as 1
          serving. However, at about 30 grams of carbs, it counts as 2 carb

        <h5 class="txt-theme">Set small and realistic goals</h5>

        <p class="txt-theme">
          Losing weight is one thing; keeping it off is another. While everyone
          wants to see the pounds fall off in the first days of a diet, drastic
          diets and extreme exercise plans aren’t sustainable. Try to focus on
          changes you can maintain for the long haul.
        </p>

        <h5 class="txt-theme">Get Active</h5>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          Aim for 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week, or 30 minutes per
          day at least 5 days a week. And remember, fitness doesn’t necessarily
          have to involve sweating for hours at the gym.
        </p>

        <h5 class="txt-theme">Schedule your meals, including breakfast</h5>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          A common characteristic among the weight control registry participants
          is that most of them reported that they ate breakfast. Skipping
          breakfast is thought to possibly lead to overeating later in the day,
          which can sabotage weight loss plans and cause blood sugar levels to
          fluctuate.
        </p>

        <h5 class="txt-theme">Cut Calories</h5>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          Staying motivated to stick with a weight loss plan ca be difficult
          when you''re going it alone. Connection with others can provid the
          emotional support you need to avoid giving up. Many weight loss
          programs are founded on the concept that support networks aid
          motivation.

        <h5 class="txt-theme">What is Insulin?</h5>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          It is a hormone made by the islet cells of the pancreas. Insulin
          controls the amount of sugar in the blood by moving it into the cells,
          where it can be used by the body for energy. It helps glucose in your
          blood enter cells in your muscle, fat, and liver, where it's used for
          energy. Glucose comes from the food you eat. The liver also makes
          glucose in times of need, such as when you're fasting
        </p>
        <h5 class="txt-theme">The Role</h5>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          Its major purpose is to regulate the body's energy supply by balancing
          micronutrient levels during the fed state. Insulin is critical for
          transporting intracellular glucose to insulin-dependent cells/tissues,
          such as liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.
        </p>
        <h5 class="txt-theme">Types of Insulin</h5>
        <h6 class="txt-theme">Basal Insulin</h6>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          Long-acting or intermediate-acting insulin. It helps stabilize blood
          sugar levels throughout the day. It provides a low and steady level of
          insulin to mimic the background insulin production in the body. This
          type of insulin is crucial for maintaining a consistent level of blood
          sugar, especially between meals and overnight
        </p>
        <h6 class="txt-theme">Isophane Insulin</h6>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          Rapid-acting or short-acting insulin. Starts to work after 1 to 2
          hours and lasts for between 11 and 24 hours. It helps control blood
          sugar levels over an extended period, making it suitable for
          maintaining a steady level of insulin in the body.
        </p>
        <h6 class="txt-theme">Biphasic (mixed) Insulin</h6>
        <p class="txt-theme">
          It is a combination of both rapid-acting and intermediate-acting
          insulin in one injection. Biphasic insulin provides both immediate and
          long-lasting blood sugar control. This type of insulin provides both
          immediate blood sugar control after meals (rapid-acting component) and
          long-lasting blood sugar control throughout the day
          (intermediate-acting component). It is beneficial for individuals who
          require both immediate and sustained blood sugar management.
